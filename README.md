Uplevelling my Python skills by participating in the 100DaysOfCode challenge. I will create folders for each project created throughout this challenge. Projects span a variety of topics from web scraping, web dev, python scripting, OOP, data science, and more. Additionally, I will maintain a log to document my progress every day.
